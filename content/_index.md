Hello and welcome! I'm Dan, a software engineer passionate about all things tech. 

This website showcases some of the projects I've worked on, but also offers insights and resources to help others explore and build their own tech solutions. I primarily use Python professionally, but also enjoy exploring other languages such as Rust, JavaScript, and C.

As an avid homelabber, I extensively use Docker to manage services. This includes self-hosting a variety of services such as Immich, a fantastic open-source alternative to Google Photos. You can find out more about my journey de-Googling my life and my homelab adventures on my blog, where I also regularly share helpful tips and tutorials.

Beyond my interest in technology, I am an ardent reader and traveler. I've been captivated by Andrzej Sapokowski's *The Witcher* series, and am a devoted fan of Bill Bryson's witty scientific and travel writing, especially his account of Australia in *Down Under*. Recently, I've retaken up my childhood hobby of Warhammer 40K, and I'm currently building and painting an Adeptus Mechanicus army.
