Hello and welcome! I'm Dan, a software engineer with a passion for technology, delivering innovative solutions, and sharing knowledge. This website showcases some of my projects and offers insights into the ideas and tools that have inspired me.

Professionally, I specialise in Python but also enjoy exploring other languages like Rust, JavaScript, and C. As an avid homelabber, I extensively use Docker to manage services, including self-hosting a variety of solutions such as Immich, a fantastic open-source alternative to Google Photos.
